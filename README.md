# python-asyncnntp
An asynchronous NNTP client for Python with SSL support.  There are no external
dependencies except for the standard library.  Not all commands have been
implemented yet, but it is useable.  Check the `examples` directory for some
simple ideas of how to use the library.

More documentation to come as well.
